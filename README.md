# The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything

Greetings.

   I have spent more than two years creating a specific mathematical model. It’s origin is at the intersection of the following areas:

*   fundamental physics
*   the theory of evolution
*   metaphysics
*   foundations of mathematics.

Unfortunately, I have not succeeded in creating the model. And at this point I have become exhausted. I ask your advice or any other help available regarding creating that model.

   The problem I’m trying to solve can be described as **to create the simplest model possible in which the evolution of the laws of nature arises from the natural selection of structures.** This approach implies indeterminism and postulates random and spontaneous nature of some events. It is also assumed that the universe had the beginning (the first moment of existence). This task is meant to provide the tychism doctrine by Charles Peirce with a mathematically accurate dynamic model.

## P.S.
I'm absolutely serious despite the fact that the title was borrowed from and comedy science fiction novel by Douglas Adams. I only think that it's useful to remember that you are looking for an answer to _The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything_ if you are really looking for it.
