<!-- [this time no redundant info] -->
<p>The goal of this article is to promote an unsolved mathematical question. And unlike typical math question it still doesn&apos;t have a formal definition. But I still find it clear enough and quite interesting. I came to this question from a philosophy direction but the question is interesting in itself.</p>
<h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<p>The notion of Turing completeness is a formalization of computability and algorithms (that previously were performed by humans and DNA). There are different formalizations (incl. Turing machine, &#x3BC;-recursive functions and &#x3BB;-calculus) but they all share the Turing completeness property and can perform equivalent algorithms. Thus they form an equivalence class.</p>
<p>The open-ended evolution is a not very popular research program which goal is to build an artificial life model with natural selection which evolution doesn&apos;t stop on some level of complexity but can progress further (ultimately to the intelligent agents after some enormous simulation time). I&apos;m not aware of the state of the progress of open-endedness criteria formulation but I&apos;m almost sure that it&apos;s still doesn&apos;t exist: as it&apos;s either connected to results of a successful simulation or to actually understanding and confirming what is required for open-endedness (I haven&apos;t heard of either).</p>
<h3 id="the-question">The question</h3>
<p>Just as algorithms performed by humans were formalized and property of Turing completeness was defined: the same formalization presumably can be done to the open-ended evolution observed in nature. It went from precellular organisms to unicellular organisms and finally to Homo sapiens driven by natural selection postulates (reproduction-doubling, heredity, variation-random, selection-death, individuals-and-environment/individuals-are-environment) and the Red Queen hypothesis that resulted in increasing complexity. Open-endedness property here is analogous to Turing completeness property. It could be formalized differently but it still would form an equivalence class.</p>
<p>And the concise formulation of this process would be something like <strong>Open-ended natural selection of interacting code-data-dual algorithms</strong>.</p>
<p>Code-data duality is needed for algorithms being able to modify each other or even themselves. I can guess that open-endedness may incorporate some weaker &quot;future potency&quot; form of Turing completeness (if to assume discrete ontology with finite space and countable-infinite time then algorithms can became arbitrary complex and access infinite memory only in infinity time limit).</p>
<p>Please consider if it&apos;s an interesting research question and share your thoughts.</p>
