### Try quantum polynomial time (BQP) machine with discrete ontology as part of OEE ontology

### Self-reference as a key to OEE?

### Discrete energy flow as a base for space and time -> hierarchy of energy levels

Base level can convert only a small amount of energy to small chunks of space (I don't know what this nonsense means). The next level can combine chunks from the previous level and hence get access to higher total energies (and more complex space structures).
