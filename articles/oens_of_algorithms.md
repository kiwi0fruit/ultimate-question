# Open-ended natural selection of interacting code-data-dual algorithms as a property analogous to Turing completeness

<!-- [this time no redundant info] -->

The goal of this article is to promote an unsolved mathematical question. And unlike typical math question it still doesn't have a formal definition. But I still find it clear enough and quite interesting. I came to this question from a philosophy direction but the question is interesting in itself.

### Preamble

The notion of Turing completeness is a formalization of computability and algorithms (that previously were performed by humans and DNA). There are different formalizations (incl. Turing machine, μ-recursive functions and λ-calculus) but they all share the Turing completeness property and can perform equivalent algorithms. Thus they form an equivalence class.

The open-ended evolution is a not very popular research program which goal is to build an artificial life model with natural selection which evolution doesn't stop on some level of complexity but can progress further (ultimately to the intelligent agents after some enormous simulation time). I'm not aware of the state of the progress of open-endedness criteria formulation but I'm almost sure that it's still doesn't exist: as it's either connected to results of a successful simulation or to actually understanding and confirming what is required for open-endedness (I haven't heard of both).


### The question

Just as algorithms performed by humans were formalized and property of Turing completeness was defined: the same formalization presumably can be done to the open-ended evolution observed in nature. It went from precellular organisms to unicellular organisms and finally to Homo sapiens driven by natural selection postulates (reproduction-doubling, heredity, variation-random, selection-death, individuals-and-environment/individuals-are-environment) and the Red Queen hypothesis that resulted in increasing complexity. Open-endedness property here is analogous to Turing completeness property. It could be formalized differently but it still would form an equivalence class.

And the concise formulation of this process would be something like **Open-ended natural selection of interacting code-data-dual algorithms**. Please consider if it's an interesting research question and share your thoughts.
