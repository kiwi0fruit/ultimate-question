# Simplest open-ended evolution model as a theory of everything

Year ago I abandoned [the research project](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalPhilosophy/comments/9hd81s/on_natural_selection_of_the_laws_of_nature/) ([repo](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/ultimate-question)). But from now on I hope to spend on it at least a few hours per week. To start with let's remember cornerstones of this research program:


1) **Open-ended evolution** (OEE) model:

* contains **natural selection** (NS) postulates (reproduction-doubling, heredity, variation-random, selection-death, individuals-**and**-environment/individuals-**are**-environment).
* in which the evolution doesn't stop on some level of complexity but can progress further to the intelligent agents after some great time.
* that should presumably incorporate: **turing-completeness** (or it's weaker "future potency" form) and **Red Queen hypothesis**.


2) By **Theory of everything** I mean:

* dynamic model of an artificial universe in which after some enormous simulation time properties of our universe is **possible** (but not necessary highly probable) but existing of intelligent life is highly **probable**.
* model that is capable of answering **all** in-model "**why these** structures exist and processes take place instead of the other?" questions by combination of transition rules postulates application and history of events (including completely random events).


3) By **simplest** I means:

* As less axioms that govern evolution of the model as possible: **Occam's razor** (OR) plus extracting **necessary and sufficient** (NaS) system transition rules that still give OEE (it may even be some equivalence class property like turing-completeness).
* In the model time is **discrete** and **countable infinite** (given by random events), there was the **first moment** of existence, space is **discrete** and **finite**. We can try starting thinking about it with a graph-like structure with individuals of NS as nodes - graph is the simplest space possible.
* This raises question: What about quantum computers? Is bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) class can be polynomially solved on machine with **discrete ontology**? And if yes what should this ontology be?
* Also I guess some may argue for lack of random events and going Everett many world quantum mechanics (QM) interpretation way. Can model
be viewed as a "superposition" of random events happened in different universes? If yes then we may get uncountable infinite space-time (btw: would superposition in QM preserve countable infinity for space-time?).
