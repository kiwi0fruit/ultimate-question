[Digital philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_philosophy) is a direction in philosophy/metaphysics that relies on computer science and theory of computation. It commonly assumes discrete and finite/countable ontology.

Posts about digital philosophy together with posts close in spirit (or logically connected) are welcome in this subreddit. For example the welcomed posts may be about:

* [digital physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_physics),
* [digital probabilistic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_probabilistic_physics),
* [artificial life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life),
* [open-ended evolution](http://www.channon.net/alastair/),
* [universal Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism) in physics,
* [philosophy of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence).

Original definition of the digital philosophy (DP) by Edward Fredkin was rather specific but for example Gregory Chaitin's ideas are indeterministic instead of deterministic but they are still considered belonging to DP. So it's more an umbrella term now.

According to Wikipedia DP is advocated by certain mathematicians and theoretical physicists, including: Edward Fredkin, Konrad Zuse, Stephen Wolfram, Rudy Rucker, Gregory Chaitin, and Seth Lloyd.
