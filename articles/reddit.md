## Intro pt.1

Greetings,

I seek advice or any other help available regarding creating a specific mathematical model. It’s origin is at the intersection of the following areas:

* fundamental physics (an important bit),
* the theory of evolution (a lot),
* metaphysics (a lot),
* foundations of mathematics and theory of computation (should be a lot).

The problem I’m trying to solve can be described as **to create the simplest artificial life model possible with open-ended evolution** (open-endedness means that the evolution doesn't stop on some level of complexity but **can** progress further to the intelligent agents after some **great** time). There are analogues to laws of nature in this dynamic model: 1) postulates of natural selection + some unknown ontological basis, 2) pool of phenotypes of evolving populations that are relatively stable on some time periods so they can be considered "laws". This approach implies indeterminism and postulates random and spontaneous nature of some events. It is also assumed that the universe had the first moment of existence with relatively simple structure.


## Intro pt.2: Key ideas

The key idea of this research program is to create an artificial universe in which we can answer any questions like "why is the present is this way not another?", "because of what?" (it's a better formulated ancient question "Why is there something rather than nothing?"). So any existing structures can be explained: as much entities as possible should have a history how they appeared/emerged - instead of postulating them directly. Moreover the model itself needs to have some justification (to be a candidate for model of the our real universe).

There are two main intuitions-constraints for this universe: 1) the start from the simple enough state (the beginning of time), 2) the complexity capable of producing sentient beings (after enormous simulation time of course) comes from natural selection which postulates are provided by universe model rules. The two intuitions give hope that **the model to build would be simple and obvious in retrospect** like postulates of natural selection are simple and obvious in **retrospect** (they are obvious, but until Darwin formulated them it was really hard to assume them). So there is a hope that **it's feasible task**.

**The model to build is a model of complexity generation. At later steps the complexity should be capable of intelligence and self-knowledge.** Sadly I have not moved far to this goal. I'm still in the situation of "I feel like the answer the this grand question can be obtained this particular way"


## Intro pt.3: Justification and best tools

Those two intuitions come from the following:

The best tool I know that can historically explain why the particular structures exist is Darwin's evolution with natural selection. And the best tools to justify the model of reality are [falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability) and [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor). First states that the theory should work and be capable of predictions. The second states that among models similar in respect to falsifiability the simplest one should be chosen.

If we are to go with natural selection as novelty generating mechanism then we should think that Lee Smolin's [Cosmological natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Smolin#Cosmological_natural_selection) (CNS) hypothesis is likely to be true. And that means that our observable universe could have had a very large number of universes-ancestors. This means that it would be really hard to apply falsifiability to the model to build. In the best case when built (sic!) it could provide the basis for General relativity + Quantum mechanics unification theory (or could not...). In the worst case we only get the restriction that our universe is possible in the model. I.e the populations of individuals that **resemble** our laws of physics should be **probable** to appear and our **particular** laws of physics are definitely **possible** to appear (either it's a group dynamic or a single individual universe like in CNS).

Luckily we also have an artificial life open-ended evolution (a-life OEE) restriction and Occam's razor. OEE means that at least in itself the model must show specific dynamics. And we already can assume that the model should be as simple as possible (and if the assumed simplicity is not enough then we should make it more complex). Though simplicity by itself cannot be a justification I have a hope that selecting the simplest workings from many **working** a-life OEE models could be a justification (proof of the theorem that the selected workings should be in every a-life OEE would be even better). And I mean a justification for basic rules that govern the dynamic of the model. By the way, this way we can justify a model obtained via any other research program. So if some "Theory of everything" appears we don't need to ask "why this particular theory?". Instead we should check for other (simpler?) models that do their work as good and then reason of necessary and sufficient criteria.

## Intro pt.4: The model

The research program uses the artificial life model with natural selection as a basis. This means taking inspiration in natural selection of biological life (**NS**). Also adding Occam's razor (**OR**) to the picture. In order to continue we need to precisely define what are individuals in the model (and environment if needed) and how the process of their replication and death takes place. There are some properties of the model we can assume and go with:

* The are **individuals and environment** (NS). _**Either**_: the individuals are the environment for other individuals - there is nothing except individuals (OR). At the beginning of the Universe there were only one or two individuals (OR). _**Or**_: there's environment of which individuals are built (and environment may not be governed by NS postulates).
* **Time is discrete and countable infinite**, there was the **first moment of existence of the Universe**, **space is discrete and finite** (OR). We can start thinking about it with a graph-like structure with individuals of NS as nodes - graph is the simplest space possible (OR, NS).
* **Reproduction**: individual has a potential to reproduce itself (NS). Individuals can **double** (OR).
* **Heredity**: properties of the individuals are inherited in reproduction (NS).
* **Variation**: when the individual reproduces itself, the reproduction does not occur precisely but with changes that are partly **random/spontaneous** (NS).
* **Natural selection**: the individuals that are more adapted to the environment survive more often (NS). It actually Captain Obvious says that "**survive those who survive**" (OR). If we use analogue with biological life then we can assume something like living in the stream of energy using the difference in entropy (so **stream-like behavior** can be put to the model). If there's nothing except individuals (no environment) then maybe node-like individuals can not only come to existence but also die and disappear.
* Natural selection and evolution are **open-ended**: they do not stop on a fixed level of complexity but instead progresses further. And they are capable of producing sentient individuals.
* The **Turing-completeness** is desired for the model: in theory there can emerge (be?) complex emergent individuals performing algorithms. Presumably **complex algorithms require a lot of space and time** so they are made up from many basic individuals.
* ...
* More **complex laws are emergent** from algorithms formed by surviving stable individuals that **change other individuals** (or environment if there's any).


## Intro pt.5: Obvious problems, incl. what is inanimate matter? what about quantum computers?

1\. If we assume that complex laws are emergent from algorithms then **what about quantum computers?** question needs answering. It can be formulated as "Is bounded-error **quantum polynomial time (BQP) class can be polynomially solved on machine with discrete ontology?**"

What is your opinion and thoughts about possible ways to get an answer whether problems that are solvable on quantum computer within polynomial time (BQP) can be solved withing polynomial time on hypothetical machine that has discrete ontology? The latter means that it doesn't use continuous manifolds and such. It only uses discrete entities and maybe rational numbers as in discrete probability theory?

2\. If we go with natural selection, use biological life as inspiration and go with assumptions above then we should answer the question: **what is the inanimate matter?**
