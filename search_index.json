I only think that it's useful to remember that you are looking for an answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything if you are really looking for it. My intuition suggests that the answer can be found in the direction described in this article. Even if it can't be found in that direction then considerations why it can't be would still be a great help to find the answer.\nP.P.S.\n\nIf you feel like you want to add something to the article or to rewrite it - feel free to fork it on GitHub, edit and make a pull request, \nNews concerning the research and discussion would appear in this blog: zagubisalo.tumblr.com, Subscibe to RSS,\nYou can discuss the letter on GitHub,\nOr send me Email:\nMarkdown source code.\n\nReturn to root\n"},"ultimate_question.html":{"url":"ultimate_question.html","title":"Ultimate Question","keywords":"","body":"The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything\n(On the task to create the simplest model in which the evolution of the laws of nature arises from the natural selection of structures)\nGreetings.\n   I have spent more than two years creating a specific mathematical model.

The physical and philosophical background of this problem ≡\n   The general idea of the research program can be summarized as follows: to describe the beginning of the universe (and its development during first time) using the language of the theory of evolution. It’s assumed that the universe had the simple starting structure (the beginning). And the task is to describe mathematically accurate the starting structure and the process of it’s development in time. It also might be that there exist convincing arguments in favor the impossibility of creating that mathematical model.\nThe idea is attractive because it assumes that the beginning of the Universe was simple and self-justifying and can be described by the mathematical model that is obvious in the retrospective: just like Darwin's idea of evolution and natural selection: they are obvious, but until they were formulated it was really hard to assume them.\n1.1 Reminding the foundations of the theory of evolution ≡\n   To begin with, I will briefly remind the foundations of the theory of evolution. This theory is the cornerstone of the research program.\n   Darwin’s theory of evolution is a theory that describes the process in which relatively simple structures transform into more complex structures under the influence of simple factors. The simple factors are the postulates of the natural selection:\n\n(p1) Population of individuals and the environment. The individuals themselves are part of the environment for other individuals.\n(p2) Natural selection: the individuals that are more adapted to the environment survive more often.\n(p3) Reproduction: each individual has a potential to reproduce itself. At least it has a potential to double the number of approximate copies of itself.\n(p4) Heredity: properties of the individuals are inherited in reproduction.\n(p5) Variation: when the individual reproduces itself, the reproduction does not occur precisely but with changes that are partly random/spontaneous (under a given set of postulates).\n\nAs noted by Karl Popper the theory of evolution is a theory of gradual changes that does not permit spontaneous appearance of monsters such as Boltzmann brain. This theory explains the entire path traversed by the life from the first unicellular organisms to Homo sapient. And they differ much in complexity.\n   The only one known to me explanation of how the complexity emerges from the simplicity is the theory of evolution. The complexity emerges by itself (!) and gradually when conditions (p1)-(p5) are met.\n1.2 The description of the research program ≡\n   As already mentioned, the general idea of the research program can be summarized as follows: to describe the beginning of the universe (and its development during first time) using the language of the theory of evolution. It’s assumed that the universe had the simple starting structure (the beginning). And the task is to describe mathematically accurate the starting structure and the process of it’s development in time.\nThis problem is put under the following assumptions:\n(a) The universe is entirely knowable by humans. The birth of the universe is also knowable. It is a kind of epistemological optimism. But at the same time, this knowledge and understanding may be unfalsifiable. The history is full of facts that can be assumed, but can not be verified (fortunately, not all the facts are such). The hypotheses about the past have this remarkable feature.\n(b) The universe is finite at every moment of time. The present was preceded by a finite number of moments of time. The assumption of finiteness is akin to intuitionistic revision of mathematics. It’s a doubt that it’s correct to use the actual infinity. It is something like Ockham’s razor: do not assume infinity until the possibility of creating a theory of a finite universe had been investigated. Since we assume the absence of actual infinity, there remains a choice between an infinite number of moments of time in the past and finite number. A finite amount is less complex, so the priority is to investigate this possibility. As a result, the potential infinity (but not the actual infinity) remains only in the process of appearance of the future moments of time.\n(c​) There is a hypothesis that using the principles of the theory of evolution we can explain the origins of everything that precedes unicellular life. At least we can explain the origins of life (abiogenesis). But it’s not the most interesting thing. The most interesting thing is to explain the origin of inanimate matter. Given the fact that the theory of evolution explains the emergence of more complex structures from less complex structures, it can be expected that the earlier back in time we “return” the more simple structures we get. It could be more simple structures in terms of yet unknown statistical description. It is still the subject of discussion. So then the question arises: how simple the structure would be at the very beginning? “Nothing”, the empty set, “unity”, “one” or concepts of comparable simplicity come to mind. It also may be a more complex structure. A simple structure but not simpler than necessary. So the development of the universe from a very primitive state driven by evolution can be assumed. This implies spontaneous events of structure changes. And with these events the structure becomes more and more complex. The postulation of spontaneous events is what occurs in (p5) “variation”. There are also intuitions that postulate (p3) “reproduction” is also very important in this picture (This postulate describes at least a doubling of the existing structures). Spontaneous symmetry breaking may also be relevant.\n   Paragraph (c​) is an intuitive guess. It echoes the ideas of Charles Peirce: his ideas of tychism and evolution of the laws of nature. In paragraph (c​) the laws of nature are like encapsulated in the evolving structures. Perhaps the laws can be derived from the structures with the help of statistical description. This, in turn, echoes the ideas of Ilya Prigogine and his attempts to get the arrow of time and irreversibility from the statistical description of ensembles in classical mechanics and his special version of quantum mechanics. There are also his ideas of synergetics and the birth of order from chaos.\n(d) Thus, the initial idea was to create a mathematical model that incorporates the following principles:\n\nA) factor of absolute spontaneity / chance / random,\nB) factor of reproduction / doubling,\nC) something akin to the law of conservation,\nD) natural selection.\n\nAnd then to see if in this model would be stable structures (patterns?) that reproduce themselves and change over time. On the other hand modern theories that describe the fundamental workings of the universe, take into account the reality as it is now. That theories make the reconstruction of the past taking into account the reality as it is now. If we are under the assumptions (a), (b), (c​), then that theories must take into account the complexity that has arisen since the birth of the universe. We can only speculate about the age of the universe before the Big Bang. For example, according to the hypothesis of cosmological natural selection [1] our observable universe could have had a very large number of universes-ancestors. So the total age of the entire universe could be enormous. The research program I have described in this letter is an attempt to cheat and do not take into account the full history and complexity that may be enormous. It’s like a research “landing operation” in the past, an attempt to describe the universe from the very beginning of it, when it had a much simpler structure. Of course, this “landing” suffers from the lack of experimental evidence and verifiability. But the first goal is a proof of the concept: to create a model of primitive structures that survive (exist) and evolve over time. It is worth mentioning that the time should be real and fundamental in this evolutionary approach which is consistent with the ideas of Lee Smolin [2]. Perhaps in case of a successful first step, the ways of linking this approach with the observable universe may be found. If not then the methods of this approach (that are yet to be found) may be brought to other areas of scientific research. Which is also good.\n(e) The presumption of the existence of the objective reality (objectivity) plays an important role in attempts to construct a mathematical model that satisfies the insights mentioned above. Objective reality can be conceived independently of the perception of observers. In mathematical physics, the objective reality is determined by specifying equivalence classes in the set of reality descriptions in terms of different observers (different coordinate systems, etc.). The dependent on the observer part of the description is not included in the equivalence class. This procedure is called “gauging away” [2].\nThe described research task is proposed to be accomplished by creating the mathematical model that is partly described in the section 2.\n2. The main features and problems of/in the mathematical model to create ≡\nThe mathematical model is constructed in the framework of research task described in the section 1.\n2.1 First overview of the mathematical model to create ≡\n   Some properties possessed by the mathematical model can already be assumed. The model is mathematical in the sense that it is required to build a unified language of envisioning and thinking about a specific process in time. This process is still far from clear and whole picture. Here I am referring to mathematics as a unified language for describing and modeling the reality and possible reality.\n   The mathematical model is intended to describe the process of changing of a particular structure (consisting of interconnected atomic parts). Moreover, it should be the process of development and complication of the structure.\n\nThe process starts from a very simple state of the structure. It may be something like “nothing”, the empty set, “unity” or “one”.\nThe rules or meta-rules of changing this simple state must also be initially defined.\nPresumably, the rules at the same time give rise to the structure that consist of interconnected atomic parts, and produce the natural selection of relatively isolated parts of the structure.\nThe structure is discrete and finite at every step. Steps of time that correspond to changes in the structure, are also discrete. And it's Ockham-razor-like to assume that the Universe is isomorphic to some endless mathematical process, but is not isomorphic to any mathematical object. This process should give complication to the structure (and structure topology).\n\n   Regarding the nature of mathematical models: mathematics, mathematical models and constructs are created by people. Before the act of creation they do not exist. But the interesting thing is that the models can be isomorphic to the part of the reality.\n2.2 The model as the process of natural selection ≡\n   There is a short list of the postulates of natural selection (there is a more detailed list of the postulates in section 1):\n\n(p1) Individuals and the environment (individuals are the only environment?)\n(p2) Selection\n(p3) Reproduction (doubling?)\n(p4) Heredity (conservation/invariability?)\n(p5) Variation (spontaneous/random?)\n\n   The process of natural selection can be viewed as the process of transferring information from the individual to it’s offspring. It is the information about possible interactions of the individual with the environment (and about reactions of the individual to these interactions). Among others this point of view is being promoted by Chris Adami [3]. Something like BVSR (“blind variation with selective retention” introduced by Donald T. Campbell [4]) can be mentioned as an example. If a specific structure of the individual promotes that the number of it’s offspring is larger than the number of competing individuals offspring then that specific structure will spread. Individuals that are less “fit” will die, and more “fit” individuals will multiply. So the information about the environment “imprints” into the structure of individuals.\n\nMost likely, in the mathematical model to be created the environment will be other individuals, and there would be nothing but individuals. It may even be very primitive “atomic” individuals (whatever that means). Presumably the Red Queen hypothesis is the main evolution driving factor.\n\nFor natural selection to work, individual and its descendants must meet very similar events and interactions. Otherwise the information will not be imprinted in the structure of the individual (actually any imprinted information will not be useful).\n\n“Reproduction” (p3) provides an environment of identical individuals. But apart from similar events they meet new and unique ones, which are provided by “variation” (p5). \n\nIf some of the desired properties were not put in the model from the beginning, it is not necessary that they will appear there later. Therefore, it is desirable that postulates of natural selection were in the model from the very beginning (from the first step?). This may even be their primitive counterparts that are surprisingly implicit in the model under construction.\n\nMost likely, spontaneous/random features are postulated in “variation (p5) about the same way as uncertainty and probabilities of the outcomes is postulated in the probability theory (using classical definition of probability).\n\n\n2.3 The model as the structure that changes in time ≡\n   Previously described point of view on the model partly shows mechanisms of it’s evolution and increasing complexity. There is also a point of view on the model as on the structure that changes in time. It is not clear what are the individuals in that structure. It can be assumed that individuals are stable patterns like waves existing in the discrete structure that consists of interconnected parts (like graph). Their origin may even be the topological curvature [5] (knots? [6] braids? [7, 8]). The patterns should be resistant to perturbations. The origin of these perturbations is not yet determined. Likely, it should take into account the postulates of the natural selection. The process of changing the structure in time can be similar to the following views:\n\nThere is only the present. The past no longer exists, the future does not exist yet. There is a description of the structure at each moment of time. The description at the next moment of time depends only on the description at the previous moment of time.\n\nThe growing universe. The structure at the next moment of time may depend on any preceding moment. Furthermore, only part of the entire structure may change at the next moment.\n\nHere we need to understand whether these views are equivalent (whether there is an isomorphism between them). Perhaps, the second description can always be reduced to the first. It all depends on specific description of the structure, which has not yet been invented.\n\nAlso, if the space-time structure will have similarities with a screw dislocation in a crystal or with a Riemann surface then the selection of “layers” of the present may be a nontrivial task. The possibility that the process of changing of the parts of the structure (space-time description) is a partially ordered set should also be investigated. In a partially ordered set not all elements of the space-time structure are comparable against relation earlier in time/later in time/same time. In contrast to a partially ordered set in a totally ordered set all elements of the space-time structure are comparable against the relation mentioned.\n\n\n2.4 The pattern in the structure is the same as the individual in the natural selection ≡\n   At the moment I’m trying to find an answer to the following question: how is it that the pattern in the structure is the same as the individual in the natural selection?\n   In other words it’s necessary to combine two previously outlined views on the process and create a complete and holistic picture. And the pattern and the individual are the same in that picture.\nThis inevitably requires answers to the following questions:\n\nWhat are the “atoms” in this structure? What’s the basis of this picture? (May be the atomic parts in the structure similar to a graph are the atomic individuals. And these atomic individuals easily increase their number. Then how do non-atomic individuals appear?)\n\nIn what places of the structure do random variations occur? What are the rules of it’s applying? This question is important, because random variations provide development and complication of the structure.\n\nWhat is the state of minimum complexity from which the process begins?\n\n\n   The question is about creation of a mathematical dynamic model that satisfies the described conditions. At this point of research I lack intuitive insights on possible structures of that model. So the possible algorithm is to generate a guess on the structure and then check whether it fits conditions. It’s mostly a mathematical problem.\n2.5 Other properties of the model: separability, meaning of life, strange loop, agents with free will, algorithms ≡\nThere are some other properties of the mathematical model to create that can be assumed. These points are even more intuitive and far-fetched than the previous.\n\nOn any steps of the process the “structure” is “separable” in a sense that it can be split into parts that we people can reason about and find the laws in. But there can be a hierarchy of such “separable” layers. I guess if the Universe didn't posses a feature like that it would not be knowable by humans. But still it is (to some big enough degree at least). So the “separability” is somehow connected with epistemological optimism (see above in the section 1.2a). I don't know of the cases where Reductionism doesn't work and hierarchy of knowable abstractions is not possible. This may mean that the natural selection rejects too topologically tangled systems (if we are under assumptions in the section 2.2). Or the entropy somehow related to this...\n\nThe idea-metaphor that I call “Cancer Langoliers” can be connected with entropy and difficulties for too topologically tangled systems. What if we look at the desired model as the structure that changes in time and imagine uncontrollably multiplying and reproducing individuals – and it's actually the basic level of the model. And the more complex structures to appear must survive in this chaotic permanently expanding mess. But the “mess” can also be non-permanently-expanding if we are to introduce some “reset” mechanism like mentioned in the next item in the list.\n\n\nThe notion of “meaning of life” can be useful for creating the model. If we look at natural selection postulates the only candidates for the “meaning of life” are 1) the competition between evolutionary branches (survival of the particular evolutionary branch not the other branches), 2) survival and complication of the all branches hence the complication of awareness of individuals of the environment and themselves. The first point seem to be more likely but the second one is also worth consideration. And embracing 1) or 2) has different impact on the properties of the model to create. As described above, the model likely should get a hierarchy of “layers” (not the time layers) and the “higher” levels should be able to contain more complexity than the previous layers. If we are to assume 2) then the model should have (by design) the chance of reseting to the previous simple layer so that the “life” in the next more complex layer “died” (in this case the meaning is to continue complication and evolution avoiding extinction and reset). But if we are only to assume 1) then that reset mechanism is not that necessary.\n\nIf we are to extend 1) point further then we can assume that the “meaning of life” is about pushing as far as possible the meaningless, historically formed structures from the past to the future. And it's about the competition between agents dragging these competing structures into the future (agents are themselves structures). If any ecological niche is free, then its occupation by someone is a foregone conclusion. But which exactly agent-structure will take it would be a matter of chance and the result of competition.\nAnother “meaning of life” may be in the choice between incompatible options for the future: that the probability of replaying any situation tends to zero over time. You could not step twice into the same river. From this point of view, the multiverse does not exist, and the point is to decide what will never happen. If the “meaning of life” is in the impossibility of replaying, then the beginning of time as a  simplest structure possible looks logical - there would be no return to that simple state.\nWhen trying to create that mentioned minimal model in graphs language (see Section 4) this question transforms to: what is the reason that the start from one vertex is more natural than from several vertices (if it never happens again)?\n\n\nFor simplicity the rules of “structure” changing might be encapsulated to the structure itself (may be atomic parts of the structure can “memorize” rules. How can this be? mind-stuff?, neural networks?). But I guess some meta-rules are inevitable but at least they desired to be derived from the simplest beginning of the Universe assumption and postulates of natural selection. But on the other hand the complete immanence of both rules/laws and meta-laws/meta-rules (when they always have a material carrier) are very attractive concept as it's a simpler one hence it's better from Occam Razor point of view. But I have a guess that immanence of meta-laws leads to the strange loop. But what if the strange loop is a valid building block of the Universe?\n\nI have no idea how that complete immanence can be possible,\nI haven't thought this through so may be the any strange-loop problem can be solved via assuming that the structure can have access not to itself but to itself-in-the-past.\n\n\nThe atomic parts of the graph might be something that is convenient to call “agents” that have an “intention” / “free will” to randomly choose from available actions that change themselves and other agents. So each agent is described by the algorithm that changes it's connected environment/neighborhood and hence changes algorithms (including the algorithm of itself). This swarm of algorithms should be capable of producing more and more complex algorithms via natural selection. This point of view raises at least two questions: (1) of simultaneity, (2) ontology of the material carrier of algorithms. (1): does natural selection need the interactions between the agents and their reproduction to be simultaneous? (2) is closely related the previous item in the list about laws/meta-laws immanence. Or simply algorithms are patterns in the structure that changes in time? I tried to think about Primitive recursive functions, μ-recursive function and Lambda calculus as a candidates for algorithms carriers but had no luck - the task was too hard for me and I felt like I missed something important... Misc:\n\nDualism of the algorithm on the one hand as instructions written into the structure and on the other hand as the executor who reads and executes the instructions. The algorithm assembles a new executor who can read the algorithm – like in DNA,\n“Space” – is an encoded map of possible actions,\nHow to control access to the environment (the same problem is also present in parallel programming)?\n“Freedom of will” is the property of the atom of the world,\nComplex algorithms require isolation of the “internal” from “external” – leads to appearing of “borders” and “shells”,\nWhat does “spatial link” mean? I always meant by this the possibility of agent's action-impact. But the “link” can also mean entanglement – restrictions on possible simultaneous states of linked objects. As John Preskill defines it [10]: “we can split a system into parts, and there is some correlation among the parts so I can learn something about one part by observing another part”. How does these two definitions relate to each other? The simplest way to combine them might be to embrace the “Spooky Action at a Distance” (gravity via entanglement theories?) and define entanglement via action-impact links,\nAll my reflections and thinking on computability and recursive functions did not give anything. What if at least partially it's because of the Church–Turing thesis that is a hypothesis about equivalence between the intuitive notion of algorithmic computability and strictly formalized notions of a partially recursive function and a function computable on a Turing machine. So until I get an intuitive grasp about it's main workings it's useless to dig into formalizations,\nMay be there should be a fundamental ontological division into the body of recursion and the base of recursion for which new notations should be introduced to the graph-like stucture.\n\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking might be an important idea regarding random variation in the natural selection. “Spontaneous” might refer to the immanence of intention to the agents. And “symmetry breaking” is necessary for random events to occur: if the symmetry doesn't break then all outcomes/impacts are equivalent and there's no randomness (“All roads lead to Rome”).\n\nAt the moment the picture in which we represent the Universe in the form of unstable energy flows (plus “batteries”) is completely ignored in my speculations. But I can't help but think that it's a very convenient point of view and language if we are to think about life and natural selection dynamics. This reminds me about Unmoved mover but it's really a far fetched association.\n\nBoth energy and information about environment are stored by agents,\nLife dies when it ceases to be a conductor of energy, living on the difference of energy: it takes energy then uses it to take more energy.\n\n\nThe solvability of the formulated problem is equivalent to the fact that the flow of time is a choice between pre-determined variants. The idea of free will is based on the idea of the pre-existence of a space of options to choose from. It resembles a notion of a flow in intuitionistic mathematics. But this process should not be the same as the flow of real numbers, but it should give the complicating of the individuals-patterns instead.\n\n\nTo sum up:\nThe notions of recursion, reproduction/doubling, randomness/spontaneous symmetry breaking and natural selection seem to be among the keys to understanding novelty creation and the Universe development from the simplest state at the beginning of time. And what about energy flows?\n2.6 Some questions and Chaotic thoughts ≡\n\nMy problem is not only in the nuances and complexities of the construction of the mathematical model. Three years of work on the problem as a hobby did not give any significant results. There is also a feeling that I could have chosen bad tools for creating the model (e.g. myself). The selected assumptions and criteria for the model may also include contradictions or other problems. So I need advice and support not only of the theoretical kind but also of the practical kind: e.g. tool selection and correction of goals.\n\nLately it became clear to me that the goal is not to build the model by myself but to build the model. I desperately need advice on how to make this mathematical model to be created (it does not matter, by me or by someone else). How can I try to think about it? Who can I try to attract to the task? Advice on a reformulation of the problem or on the correctness of the problem is also very welcome.\n\nMay be I make the same mistake that the ancient cosmogony myths creators did. They only knew about people “creators” that are capable of creating novelty. So they introduced gods/demiurges as creators in their cosmogony. Like them I only know about natural selection postulates as a way of creating something new so I try to make up a cosmogony from that. What if there is another way to create novelty? And it's passing Ockham Razor simplicity criteria and also starts from simple Universe state at the beginning of time.\n\nSeems like postulates of natural selection is not enough for creation the desired mathematical model. Do we need one more simple postulate? Or do we need something completely new? Or may be we simply need another point of view?\n\n\nChaotic thoughts\nThere is also a list of thoughts, notes and questions that at some point seemed relevant to me but are such a mess actually:\n\nIt is necessary that in the intuitive prototype of the model there are already ideas about how natural selection of more complex stable structures takes place. That is, you do not need to invent a model, and then expect and check that there is something in it.\nHere Sabine Hossenfelder writes that beauty is not that importaint. But we actually should not expect it everywhere if we are to assume natural selection.\nThe picture of a graph in which the vertices send each other quants of action-energy looks like a neural network. Neural networks can work well in a stream. That is, the continuous flow for them is OK. Close related tensor networks are used in fundamental physics, theories of consciousness and AI development (deep learning).\nDo we really need the notion of information? Information - is the reflection of the the structure of the environment in the structure of the agent. And the process of transmitting the information – is the process of updating the structure of the agent to better fit the environment.\nFor better understanding may be useful to clarify the analogy between the interpretations of quantum mechanics (Many-worlds vs. Copenhagen) and the descriptions of series of random events (like coin tosses): when we describe all future possible outcomes as a single expression (are they all real?) vs. when we remember that only one “branch” would be real.\nThe drawback of the schemes proposed in the section 4.2: any stages of copying must be ontologically real and meaningful. And if the algorithm for forming the structure at a new time step based on the old time step one has stages, then these stages must be split into real time steps,\nWhat if the present doesn't morph into future but creates the future? So when trying to create models like in section 4.2 the creation of the next step from previous step should be explicit: if something is not created then this will not be in the future. This point of view may be more convenient for natural selection.\n\n3. On artificial life, open ended evolution and “why these laws of nature?” question ≡\n   My main goal briefly and correctly: to create a model of Open Ended Evolution (Then test it on the PC. May be even with hardware random number generator). The good overview of the Open Ended Evolution problem is given by Alastair Channon: channon.net/alastair [9]. This name states for an artificial life that don’t stop it’s evolution on a fixed level of complexity but instead progresses further. The only difference seem to be that the model I’d like to create is planned to be the simplest model. To be the simplest in the philosophical sense. Like Occam’s razor. These restrictions of simplicity make the difficulties that I was describing in this open letter (start from the simplest structure, no predetermined structures except natural selection postulates, no environment, only individuals).\n   And the final goal is to answer the “why these laws of nature?” question. More precisely: why these processes take place but not the other. The history in the model of natural selection is a perfect explanation (if we know the whole history) and answer to any “why?” question. But for the model of open ended evolution to be a candidate for a model of the beginning of the universe it should be the simplest model possible (from the philosophical reasoning).\n4. The minimum mathematical model for open ended evolution (the more precise description of the mathematical part) ≡\n4.1 Possible restrictions and constraints of the model ≡\nHere is an attempt to describe the restrictions and constraints mentioned in section 3 (and described in more details in the open letter) in a more formal way.\n\nThe model describes process of discrete changes of the graph-like structure.\n\nThe process starts from the graph consisting of the only one vertex. There are no edges.\n\nThe predetermined rules are applied to the existing graph to get the next graph.\n\nThe predetermined rules should include the rules that resemble the postulates of natural selection:\n\n4.1 “Reproduction” (may be: spontaneous events of doubling of the vertices)\n4.2 “Heredity” (may be: conservation or invariability of some subgraph of the graph. Or subset of the set of edges of a particular vertex)\n4.3 “Variation” (may be: spontaneous events of changing the vertices’ edges during reproduction. There are more than one such events so there are random choices in most cases)\n4.4 “Selection” (I’m not sure but there also may be the events of joining two vertices into one. May be this event is applied only to the two vertices that share in their history the same event of doubling)  \n\n\nAs I see it now the edges of the vertices appear to be the structure of the individuals in the natural selection. But I may be wrong.\n\nThe are two ways of imagining this process:\n\n6.1 Do not draw the history of rules application. First step: o, Second step: o―o. Here the rule of reproduction was applied.\n6.2 Do draw the history of rules application. First step: o, Second step:\n In this picture the history of reproduction was taken into account. And directed edges are used to denote events of application of the rules to the graph (or to the subgraph of it).  \n\n\n\nDuring the process of rules application (partially randomly) we get the history of graph changes. The process of creating such a history is an infinite process.\n\nIn the history of this process should be patterns in the graph that are isomorphic to each other in some sense. If we are imagining the process like in 6.2 then the isomorphic patterns should be found both in time direction and in graph structure. The simplest analogue to this is the waves propagating in the medium.\n\nMoreover there should be the evolution of such patterns that lead to their complication and incorporation the information about the graph structure or about other patterns. Presumably this evolution is led by competition for “staying alive” of such patterns with each other.\n\nThis evolution should not stop at the fixed level of pattern complexity. So it should be the case of Open Ended Evolution.\n\n\nPresumably, the model to be built should satisfy the 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10 constraints. Other constraints may be altered to fit the 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10 constraints.\nSo it's my guess that formal models that satisfy the constraints mentioned can be constructed. But this attempt to describe the constraints is also a request for convincing arguments in favor that the model satisfying the constraints is impossible.\nSome notes:\n\nPresumably, there are many “layers” on which populations exist. The vertices themselves are the atomic individuals that are characterized by their edges. All the vertices are the basic population (basic level). But the goal of the model is to get the individuals at next levels: as patterns in the graph (there may be even cycles of patterns changing to each other, like wave). The interesting individuals are patterns (subgraphs that persist in the changing graph during time). And there expected layers on layers.\n\nFrom some point of view my task to create this specific model is an attempt to figure out whether postulates of natural selection are sufficient for evolution with endless complication (given the simplest beginning structure possible) or not sufficient.\n\nThe constraint that the process starts from the graph consisting of the only one vertex may be wrong. The cases where there are two or three (but no more) vertices at the beginning should also be investigated.\n\n\n4.2 Examples of the models that resemble the desired model ≡\nHere is the a try to create a mathematical dynamic model that satisfies some of the constraints mentioned. I doubt that it would succeed. But it may show some problems and make the limitations of this approach more clear.\n4.2.1 The first example ≡\nThe decsription of the first model:\n\nThe model describes process of discrete changes of the undirected graph structure.\nEach vertex has a boolean label “True” or “False”.\nThe process starts from the graph consisting of the only one vertex. There are no edges. The vertex has a “True” label.\nThe predetermined rules are applied to the existing graph to get the next graph.\nThe predetermined rules that are applied simultaneously:\n5.1 “Reproduction”. If “parent” vertex’s label is “True” then it reproduces and the “child” vertex is created. The “child” vertex has a “True” label.\n5.2 “Variation” + “Heredity”. There is a ½ probability for each edge of “parent” vertex to be in the edges set of “child” vertex.\n5.3 “Heredity”. The edge is always created between the “parent” and “child” vertices.\n5.4 “Selection”. Forget about the newly created “child” vertices (temporary remove them from the consideration). For each vertex in the reduced graph: If vertex’s label is “True” then for each edge of this vertex the “True” signal is send with ½ probability to the vertex’s neighbors. Then again for each vertex in the reduced graph: If at least one “True” signal came to the vertex then it’s label would be “True” on the next time step. Otherwise is’s label would be “False”.\n\n\n\nLet’s draw some steps of this process. “True” vertices would be white. “False” vertices would be black.\n\nStart (numbers distinguish vertices):[○1]\nOnly 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4 were applied (no edges so no “True” signals):[●1]――[○2]\nThere are randomly selected outcomes:\n3.1 [○1]――[●2]――[○3]\n3.2 [●1]――[●2]――[○3]\n3.3 [○1]――[●2]――[○3]    ┕―――――――┚\n3.4 [●1]――[●2]――[○3]    ┕―――――――┚\n\n\nThere are even more randomly selected outcomes on this step. So the computer simulation is required.\n\n4.2.2 The second example ≡\nThere is another model that is more simple in some sense.\nThe description of the second model:\n\nThe model describes process of discrete changes of the undirected graph structure.\nEach vertex has a non-negative integer label (l≥0, l∈ℕ).\nThe process starts from the graph consisting of the only one vertex. It has only one loop edge that connects vertex to itself (and it counts as one edge). The vertex has a “1” label.\nThe predetermined rules are applied to the existing graph to get the next graph.\nThe predetermined rules that are applied in two stages:\n5.1 “Individuals and Environment”. For each vertex in the graph: if vertex’s label is positive integer n then n times do the following: the “1” signal is send to an edge that is randomly selected from the vertex’s edges set (including the edge to itself). If the vertex has m edges then the probability is 1/m. Actually the signal is sent to the vertex’s neighbors. Then again for each vertex in the graph: if n signals came to the vertex then it’s label is set to “n”. It can be “0”.\n5.2 “Reproduction”. For each vertex in the graph (“parent” vertices): if “parent” vertex’s label is positive integer then it reproduces and the “child” vertex is created. The “child” vertex has a “1” label. The edge that connects “child” vertex to itself is always created.\n5.3 “Variation and Heredity”. For each “child” vertex in the graph: If signal came from “X” vertex to “parent” vertex then the “child” vertex has an edge to the “X” vertex.\n5.4 “Selection”. For each vertex in the graph: If vertex’s label is “0” then the vertex is removed from the graph together with all it’s edges.\n\n\n\nLet’s draw some steps of this process. First number distinguish vertices, ∩ reminds on the self edge, ↕ shows that the signal is sent along the self edge, last number is a label:\n\n1. [∩1]\n2.1 1[↕1]\n2.2 1[∩1]――2[∩1]\n3. There are randomly selected outcomes:\n\n3.1 1[∩1]←→2[∩1]4[∩1]――1[∩1]――2[∩1]――3[∩1][∩1]――[∩1]――[∩1]――[∩1]\n\n3.2 1[∩0]―→2[↕2]1[∩0]――2[∩2]――3[∩1]  ┕――――――――┚2[∩2]――3[∩1][∩2]――[∩1]\n\n3.3 1[↕2]←―2[∩0]3[∩1]――1[∩2]――2[∩0]  ┕――――――――┚1[∩2]――3[∩1][∩2]――[∩1]\n\n3.4 1[↕1]――2[↕1]3[∩1]――1[∩1]――2[∩1]――4[∩1][∩1]――[∩1]――[∩1]――[∩1]\n\n4. 1[∩2]――2[∩1]\n\n4.1 1[∩2]――2[∩1]1[↕1]―→2[↕2]3[∩1]――1[∩1]――2[∩2]――4[∩1]         ┕――――――――┚[∩1]――[∩1]――[∩2]――[∩1]         ┕―――――――┚\n\n4.2 1[∩2]――2[∩1]1[↕↕2]――2[↕1]3[∩1]==1[∩2]――2[∩1]――4[∩1]\n\n\nSeems like the weighted edges are required… There are more randomly selected outcomes on this step. So the computer simulation is required to speed up the research.\n5. Why this task? On “Why is there something rather than nothing?” question ≡\n   The two described tasks (1. to get laws of nature from natural selection of structures. 2. to create the minimum mathematical model for open ended evolution) are actually the same task.\n   The minimal open ended evolution model (OEE model) that are to be created should be capable of producing at its future steps the invariant behavior of really huge number of individuals. And this invariant behavior may be called the laws of nature. I have doubts that we will ever have enough computational power to run the simulation long enough to get this invariant behavior. But who knows?\n   Actually I have a guess (that is to be checked) that if this minimum OEE model exists then it’s really a simple one. It should have a simple structure, but it’s not easy to formulate it right. It’s like the postulates of natural selection: they are obvious, but until they were formulated it was really hard to assume them.\n   And this model is a request from philosophy. It’s actually a philosophical mathematics that uses physics and natural selection theory for inspiration. It’s a task to create explanation framework that answers any “why questions” in the same way that theory of evolution answers lots of why questions on origin of different life forms. If this explanation framework exist then it should answer the ancient question “Why is there something rather than nothing?”. It is rather strange to use laws of nature to answer this question. It’s like a joke about creationist-evolutionist debate: “The God created all the evidence of the evolution”, says creationist. Then the evolutionist replies: “It’s the same as to assume that the God created the world this morning. And he has created me already unshaven”. So all pre-existing structures need explanation (including laws of nature). My current guess is that the model I started to build in chapter 4 “The minimum mathematical model for open ended evolution (the more precise description of the mathematical part)” lacks something like the “Law of habit” by Charles Peirce or the “Principle of Precedence” by Lee Smolin.\nUPD. Examples of models from section 4 have highlighted the need for a more consistent justification of the original rules for modifying the graph.\n6. P.S. ≡\nI'm absolutely serious in spite of the fact that the title was borrowed from the comedy science fiction novel by Douglas Adams. I only think that it's useful to remember that you are looking for an answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything if you are really looking for it. My intuition suggests that the answer can be found in the direction described in this article. Even if it can't be found in that direction then considerations why it can't be would still be a great help to find the answer.\nI would be grateful for any feedback and advice.\nPeter Zagubisalo, January 2016, minor update July 2018  \n7.

It is also assumed that the universe had the beginning (the first moment of existence). This task is meant to provide the tychism doctrine by Charles Peirce with a mathematically accurate dynamic model.\nThe mathematical model is intended to describe the process of changing of a discrete structure (like graph, consisting of interconnected atomic parts). Moreover, it should be the process of development and complication of the structure.\n1. The model as the process of natural selection\nThe postulates of natural selection:\n\n(p1) Individuals and the environment (individuals are the environment?)\n(p2) Natural selection\n(p3) Reproduction (doubling?)\n(p4) Heredity (conservation/invariability?)\n(p5) Variation (spontaneous/random?)\n\nDuring natural selection the information about the environment “imprints” into the structure of individuals.\nPresumably the environment will be other individuals, and there would be nothing but individuals. It may even be very primitive “atomic” individuals (whatever that means).\nFor natural selection to work, individual and its descendants must meet very similar events and interactions. “Reproduction” (p3) provides an environment of identical individuals. But apart from similar events they meet new and unique ones, which are provided by “variation” (p5).\n2. The model as the structure that changes in time\nIt can be assumed that individuals are stable patterns like waves existing in the discrete structure. Their origin may even be the topological curvature (knots? braids?). The patterns should be resistant to perturbations. Presumably perturbations arise from reproduction and variation postulates of natural selection.\nThe process starts from a very simple state of the structure. It may be something like “nothing”, the empty set, “unity” or “one”. But the state of minimum complexity from which the process begins is still under consideration.\nThe rules or meta-rules of changing this simple state must be initially defined.\nPresumably, the rules at the same time give rise to the structure that consist of interconnected atomic parts, and produce the natural selection of patterns in the structure.\nThe structure is discrete and finite. Steps of time that correspond to changes in the structure, are also discrete.\n3. So the two views on the model to create:\n\nThe model as the process of natural selection\nThe model as the structure that changes in time.\n\nThe subproblem I’m trying to solve at the moment is the following:\n1) How is it that the pattern in the structure is the same as the individual in the natural selection? So it’s necessary to combine two views on the process and create a complete and holistic picture. And the pattern and the individual are the same in that picture.\n2) What are the “atoms” in this structure? What’s the basis of this picture? May be the atomic parts in the structure similar to a graph are the atomic individuals. And these atomic individuals easily increase their number. Then how do non-atomic individuals appear?\nSo my question is a request for intuitions on how to create that complete picture that satisfies the constraints.\nMore details on this research problem are described in this article: ultimate_question\nP.S.\nMy main goal briefly and correctly: to create a model of Open Ended Evolution (Then test it on the PC. May be even with hardware random number generator). The good overview of the Open Ended Evolution problem is given by Alastair Channon: channon.net/alastair. This name states for an artificial life that don’t stop it’s evolution on a fixed level of complexity but instead progresses further. The only difference seem to be that the model I’d like to create is planned to be the simplest model. To be the simplest in the philosophical sence. Like Occam’s razor. These restrictions of simplicity make the difficulties that I was describing in this question and the open letter (start from the simplest structure, no predetermined structures exept natural selection postulates, no environment, only individuals).\nAnd the final goal is to answer the “why these laws of nature?” question. More precisly: why these processes take place but not the other. The history in the model of natural selection is a perfect expanation (if we know the whole history) and answer to any “why?” question. But for the model of open ended evolution to be a candidate for a model of the beginning of the universe it should be the simplest model possible (from the philosophical reasoning).\nReturn to root\n"}}}
