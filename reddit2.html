<p>This is a continuation of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/97s8dl/on_natural_selection_of_the_laws_of_nature/" target="_blank">On natural selection of the laws of nature, Artificial life and Open-ended evolution, Universal Darwinism, Occam&apos;s razor</a> reddit post. First I&apos;ll add some details about self-justifying that show <em>more</em> about the motivation behind the research. Then I describe the particular question about the model to build.</p>

<h2 id="self-justifying-theory-of-everything">Self-justifying theory of everything</h2>
<p>Potential theories of everything can be <strong>self-justifying</strong> or not. It means that the theory is:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>theory of everything</strong>: capable of answering all questions like &quot;why these structures exist / processes take place instead of the other ones?&quot;. I.e. given all knowledge about the past they can (at least theoretically) track chains of causes back to the past to the moments where they came to existence.</li>
<li><strong>self-justifying</strong>: capable of answering question &quot;why the theory of everything works this way not another?&quot;. And answer &quot;because it&apos;s predictions are in agreement with experiments&quot; is not enough because there can be infinite number of such theories that differ in things we cannot test (yet? never? who knows...). So we can either wait for General relativity + Quantum mechanics unification (and see if there would be the same problem :) or we can try to answer this question via self-justifying. It relies on philosophical necessity, Occam&apos;s razor, Captain Obvious considerations and common sense.</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I know candidates for theory of everything that are being developed by physicists are not meant to be build self-justifying. But in the past the self-justifying cosmogonies were build. The simplest one starts from the sentient god-creator. The god was at the beginning of time and he is self-justifying. It can be imagined as the Universe starts with artificial general intelligence agent with goals. Then AGI creates everything else...</p>
<p>I suggest use similar approach but use natural selection instead of AGI. We know that biological natural selection is capable of producing sentient individuals and it&apos;s simpler than AGI from Occam&apos;s razor point of view. This assumes that the fundamental aspect of the Universe if the life (instead of AGI/god or predefined mechanical-like laws).</p>
<h2 id="artificial-life-model-as-a-self-justifying-theory-of-everything">Artificial life model as a self-justifying theory of everything</h2>
<p>As was described in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/97s8dl/on_natural_selection_of_the_laws_of_nature/" target="_blank">previous post</a> there are some properties of the model we can assume and go with:</p>
<p>Use idea of the artificial life model with natural selection as a basis for the self-justifying theory of everything. This means taking inspiration in natural selection of biological life (<strong>NS</strong>). Also adding Occam&apos;s razor (<strong>OR</strong>) to the picture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time is discrete and countable infinite, there was the first moment of existence of the Universe, space is discrete and finite (OR). We can start thinking about it with a graph-like structure.</li>
<li>The are individuals and environment (NS). The individuals are the environment for other individuals - there is nothing except individuals (OR). At the beginning of the Universe there were only one or two individuals (OR).</li>
<li>Reproduction: individual has a potential to reproduce itself (NS). Individuals can double (OR).</li>
<li>Heredity: properties of the individuals are inherited in reproduction (NS).</li>
<li>Variation: when the individual reproduces itself, the reproduction does not occur precisely but with changes that are partly random/spontaneous (NS).</li>
<li>Natural selection: the individuals that are more adapted to the environment survive more often (NS). It actually Captain Obvious says that &quot;survive those who survive&quot; (OR). If we use analogue with biological life then we can assume something like living in the stream of energy using the difference in entropy (so stream-like behavior can be put to the model).</li>
<li>Natural selection and evolution are open-ended: they do not stop on a fixed level of complexity but instead progresses further. And they are capable of producing sentient individuals.</li>
<li>The Turing-completeness is desired for the model: in theory there can emerge (be?) complex individuals performing algorithms. Presumably complex algorithms require a lot of space and time.</li>
<li>More intuitions about the model to build are in the <a href="https://kiwi0fruit.github.io/ultimate-question/" target="_blank">original article</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="help-needed-to-solve-the-question-what-is-the-inanimate-matter">Help needed to solve the question: What is the inanimate matter?</h2>
<p>If we go with natural selection, use biological life as inspiration and go with assumptions above then we should answer the question: <strong>what is the inanimate matter</strong>?</p>
<p>As for biological life the inanimate matter is only an environment. And if we have only individuals in the model then why the inanimate matter in our Universe is so stable? Because in the biological life there is always the threat of cancer that is an error in the reproduction algorithm. Why some elemental particles never ever &quot;mutate&quot;? (only expanding space puts some doubts to the picture but it doesn&apos;t seem to be related to the question). <strong>This requires explaining via model assumptions or correcting them</strong>.</p>
<p>Ideas about possible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Somehow add inanimate matter into the model. But what would it be? And why this particular way?</li>
<li>Use an analogy with stem cells, ordinary cells and already dead skin cells: that there can be a fundamental transition to a state in which it is impossible to reproduce.</li>
<li>Particles can be as though encoded as resistant to interference, self-correcting code, etc.</li>
<li>Do not forget that if then we are to go with natural selection thing then we should think that Lee Smolin&apos;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Smolin#Cosmological_natural_selection" target="_blank">Cosmological natural selection</a> hypothesis is likely to be true. And that means that our observable universe could have had a very large number of universes-ancestors. This may expand possible ways of explaining the inanimate matter.</li>
</ul>
