* Here [Sabine Hossenfelder](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=10314) writes that beauty in not that importaint. But we actually should not expect it everywhere if we are to assume natural selection.
* What is the reason that the start from one vertex is more natural than from several vertices (if it never happens again)?
* The picture of a graph in which the vertices send each other quants of action-energy looks like a neural network. Neural networks can work well in a stream. That is, the continuous flow for them is OK. Close related tensor networks are used in fundamental physics, theories of consciousness and AI development (deep learning).
