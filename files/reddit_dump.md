## Toward a theory of evolution as multilevel learning

Vitaly Vanchurin, Yuri I. Wolf, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, and Eugene V. Koonin

### Abstract

We apply the theory of learning to physically renormalizable systems in an attempt to outline a theory of biological evolution, including the origin of life, as multilevel learning. We formulate seven fundamental principles of evolution that appear to be necessary and sufficient to render a universe observable and show that they entail the major features of biological evolution, including replication and natural selection. It is shown that these cornerstone phenomena of biology emerge from the fundamental features of learning dynamics such as the existence of a loss function, which is minimized during learning. We then sketch the theory of evolution using the mathematical framework of neural networks, which provides for detailed analysis of evolutionary phenomena. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed theoretical framework, we derive a generalized version of the Central Dogma of molecular biology by analyzing the flow of information during learning (back propagation) and predicting (forward propagation) the environment by evolving organisms. The more complex evolutionary phenomena, such as major transitions in evolution (in particular, the origin of life), have to be analyzed in the thermodynamic limit, which is described in detail in the paper by Vanchurin et al.

## What are the biggest questions in ALife? My take: are quantum computing capabilities essential to get open-ended evolution?

More specificaly it's what ontology is enough to get [open-ended evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/oee/). I have no idea... My best guess is to apply the best available model of computation. That's quantum computing at the moment. This would mean that current computers can only slowly emulate quantum computing that might be essential for open-ended evolution. And this also leads to the question whether we really need continuous (uncountable) ontology of the quantum mechanics to get quantum computer behaviour: [Is bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) class can be polynomially solved on machine with discrete ontology?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalPhilosophy/comments/9lyeft/is_boundederror_quantum_polynomial_time_bqp_class/) (countable ontology).

This area is out of my expertise so I should first understand quantum computing from the mathematical point of view: [PHYS771 Lecture 9: Quantum (by Scott Aaronson)](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html). As far as I heard that's the best introduction view of the quantum computing.

P.S. I've just read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alife/comments/mz665s/what_are_the_biggest_questions_in_alife/) in r/alife.

## [Offtopic] Anattā (non-self) from Buddhism is a predecessor of the epistemic part of the Buddha-Darwinism

**[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta)**

Though getting non-self in the [Buddha-Darwinism](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/ultimate-question/blob/master/articles/dxb.md) from quasi-immortality leads to drastically different morals than Buddhism ones (which doesn't use quasi-immortality).

*UPD: Well, non-self is not epistemic, but ontological in Buddhism and a conclusion from ontology in Buddha-Darwinism.*

## Summing up meta-ethical conclusions that can be derived from Universal Darwinism taken to extremes

Yep. That's actually another possible title for the "[Applying Universal Darwinism to evaluation of Terminal values](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/ultimate-question/blob/master/articles/dxb.md)" article. Aka Buddha-Darwinism on objective meaning of life separated from subjective meaning of life (Cosmogonic myth from Darwinian natural selection, Quasi-immortality, Free will, Buddhism-like illusion of the “Self”)

### Abstract

This article sums up meta-ethical conclusions that can be derived from Universal Darwinism taken to extremes. In particular it 1) applies Universal Darwinism to evaluation of Terminal values, 2) separates objective meaning of life from subjective meaning of life using notion of Quasi-immortality. That means both moral nauralism and moral non-cognitivism are right but in different areas, 3) justifies the free will as a consequence of the Universal Darwinism, 4) comes to the conclusion of Buddhism-like illusion of the “Self” as a consequence of the Quasi-immortality, 5) as a bonus gives Universal Darwinism a hypothetical and vivid Cosmogonic myth from Darwinian natural selection. The article forms a coherent system of views, which can be called Buddha-Darwinism.

## My comment on "Practically-A-Book Review: Yudkowsky Contra Ngo On Agents" by Scott Alexander

https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/practically-a-book-review-yudkowsky/comment/4567560

From the end of the Part 3:

> If the malevolent agent would get more reward than the normal well-functioning tool (which we’re assuming is true; it can do various kinds of illicit reward hacking), then applying enough gradient descent to it could accidentally complete the circuit and tell it to use its agent model.

But what does this even mean? Why is malevolence important? If "dreaming" of being a real agent (using some subsystem) would output a better results for an "oracle-tool" then its loss funtion would converge on always dreaming like a real agent. There is a risk but it's not malevolent =)

And then we can imaging it dreaming of a solution to a task that is most likely to succeed if it obtains real agency and gains direct control on the sutuation. And it "knows" that for this plan to succeed it should hide it from humans.

So this turned into "lies alignment" problem. In this case why even bother with values alignment?

### Comments

By the way. What is the end-goal of humans in here? Some previous thoughts on this (very superficial and simply to start the conversation):

> Over time, human cyborgization and augmentation using AI will leave less and less human in people. In the future limit if the goal is to keep humanity in its current form, the super AI will maintain the existence of humanity as merely a ritual integrated into its goals. Just like a super AI which sole purpose is to make paper clips. In order to prevent such a dull ending ..., it is necessary that super AI come directly from digitized people (with all their values), augmented by AI. But maybe I'm overly pessimistic, and a combination of super AI with genetically modified people who are in charge and make decisions will also work.

## Modern sciense ontology is a Last Thursdayism implicitly

### (this doesn't diminish physics predictive power)

Especially multiverse paired with anthropic principle suffers from this. It happens because of the lack of solid [novelty emergence mechanics](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/ultimate-question/blob/master/articles/novelty.md). Attempts to fix it give us ad hock patches to not get [Boltzmann brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain) variant as the most probable sentient life.

## Novelty emergence mechanics as a core idea of any viable ontology of the universe

I'm sure that any ontology that desires to be applicable to the universe as a whole should contain novelty emergence mechanics.

> Before natural selection was discovered it was natural to believe-assume that the entire universe was created by primordial general intelligence (aka God) as intelligence was the only known thing capable of explaining novelty emergence. Evolution and natural selection is the best explanation for novelty emergence that we have at the moment: an endless process of survival and accumulation of novelty.

*Quote from [Applying Universal Darwinism to evaluation of Terminal values](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/ultimate-question/blob/master/articles/dxb.md)* aka *Buddha-Darwinism on objective meaning of life separated from subjective meaning of life (Cosmogonic myth from Darwinian natural selection, Quasi-immortality, Free will, Buddhism-like illusion of the “Self”)*.

Desire for novelty emergence explanation comes from reformulated ancient question "why is there something rather
than nothing?". Reformulated into: "why these structures exist instead of other?"

And at the moment we really don't have a better mechanism-explanation for novelty emergence (in general) than natural selection.

Hence it would be a good try to embrace [Universal Darwinism](https://m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism) as an important part of a hypothetical ontology suitable for the universe as a whole. But surely natural selection by itself is not enough for ontology. But I believe that it's one of the core components.

## Evaluating terminal values

How to evaluate terminal values of humans (defined like on [lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/terminal-value))? Quote:

> A terminal value (also known as an intrinsic value) is an ultimate goal, an end-in-itself. ... In an [artificial general intelligence](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/artificial-general-intelligence) with a [utility](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/utility-functions) or reward function, the terminal value is the maximization of that function.

Values are subjective but the question asks for some objective perspective. This question is of interest as “Humans' terminal values are often mutually contradictory, inconsistent, and changeable”.

Obviousness of natural selection (NS) can pose some constraints, albeit weak ones, as all known systems with sentient agents abide NS. But weak constraints are still better than no constraints at all.

Terminal goals are being split by natural selection into ones that fail to reproduce / maintain themselves and ones that survive (together with their bearers of cource). And sometimes we can even predict whether some terminal goals would go extinct or at least range their probability of survival (we already had put aside instrumental goals that “die” when they lose their purpose.).

So that's it. That's the only way to objectively judge terminal values I'm aware of. And judgment part comes from a feeling that I don't want to be invested in terminal goals that would most likely go extinct. At least they should be “mutated” in way to balance minimization of their change and maximization of their survival probability to be appealing.

*Are you aware of any other ways to evaluate terminal values?*

P.S. Basically, that post was a recap of a part of the more poetic and “old school” article that I've written: [Applying Universal Darwinism to evaluation of Terminal values](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/ultimate-question/blob/master/articles/dxb.md). The article doesn't add anything important to the question of this post but mostly stretches Universal Darwinism in other direstions instead.

## Do you see a way use abstract rewriting system over graphs from Wolfram Physics Project to represent code-data dual algothms that modify each other and form natural selection process?

Article [Some Relativistic and Gravitational Properties of the Wolfram
Model (by Jonathan Gorard - 2020)](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/Documents/some-relativistic-and-gravitational-properties-of-the-wolfram-model.pdf) has interesting definition of abstract rewriting systems that work on graphs.

Do you see a way to use them to represent [code-data dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_as_data) algorithms that modify each other and form natural selection process? That could be a nice base for open-ended natural selection a-life model.
