### Toward a theory of evolution as multilevel learning

Vitaly Vanchurin, Yuri I. Wolf, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, and Eugene V. Koonin

Abstract:

We apply the theory of learning to physically renormalizable systems in an attempt to outline a theory of biological evolution, including the origin of life, as multilevel learning. We formulate seven fundamental principles of evolution that appear to be necessary and sufficient to render a universe observable and show that they entail the major features of biological evolution, including replication and natural selection. It is shown that these cornerstone phenomena of biology emerge from the fundamental features of learning dynamics such as the existence of a loss function, which is minimized during learning. We then sketch the theory of evolution using the mathematical framework of neural networks, which provides for detailed analysis of evolutionary phenomena. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed theoretical framework, we derive a generalized version of the Central Dogma of molecular biology by analyzing the flow of information during learning (back propagation) and predicting (forward propagation) the environment by evolving organisms. The more complex evolutionary phenomena, such as major transitions in evolution (in particular, the origin of life), have to be analyzed in the thermodynamic limit, which is described in detail in the paper by Vanchurin et al.

### What are the biggest questions in ALife? My take: are quantum computing capabilities essential to get open-ended evolution?

More specificaly it's what ontology is enough to get [open-ended evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/oee/). I have no idea... My best guess is to apply the best available model of computation. That's quantum computing at the moment. This would mean that current computers can only slowly emulate quantum computing that might be essential for open-ended evolution. And this also leads to the question whether we really need continuous (uncountable) ontology of the quantum mechanics to get quantum computer behaviour: [Is bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) class can be polynomially solved on machine with discrete ontology?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalPhilosophy/comments/9lyeft/is_boundederror_quantum_polynomial_time_bqp_class/) (countable ontology).

This area is out of my expertise so I should first understand quantum computing from the mathematical point of view: [PHYS771 Lecture 9: Quantum (by Scott Aaronson)](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html). As far as I heard that's the best introduction view of the quantum computing.

P.S. I've just read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alife/comments/mz665s/what_are_the_biggest_questions_in_alife/) in r/alife.

### [Offtopic] Anattā (non-self) from Buddhism is a predecessor of the epistemic part of the Buddha-Darwinism

**[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta)**

Though getting non-self in the [Buddha-Darwinism](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/ultimate-question/blob/master/articles/dxb.md) from quasi-immortality leads to drastically different morals than Buddhism ones (which doesn't use quasi-immortality).

*UPD: Well, non-self is not epistemic, but ontological in Buddhism and a conclusion from ontology in Buddha-Darwinism.*

### Summing up meta-ethical conclusions that can be derived from Universal Darwinism taken to extremes

Yep. That's actually another possible title for the "[Applying Universal Darwinism to evaluation of Terminal values](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/ultimate-question/blob/master/articles/dxb.md)" article. Aka Buddha-Darwinism on objective meaning of life separated from subjective meaning of life (Cosmogonic myth from Darwinian natural selection, Quasi-immortality, Free will, Buddhism-like illusion of the “Self”)

### Abstract

This article sums up meta-ethical conclusions that can be derived from Universal Darwinism taken to extremes. In particular it 1) applies Universal Darwinism to evaluation of Terminal values, 2) separates objective meaning of life from subjective meaning of life using notion of Quasi-immortality. That means both moral nauralism and moral non-cognitivism are right but in different areas, 3) justifies the free will as a consequence of the Universal Darwinism, 4) comes to the conclusion of Buddhism-like illusion of the “Self” as a consequence of the Quasi-immortality, 5) as a bonus gives Universal Darwinism a hypothetical and vivid Cosmogonic myth from Darwinian natural selection. The article forms a coherent system of views, which can be called Buddha-Darwinism.
